## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app is an assignment tool we use at my current company. Currently we use and old tool created years ago in VB6. The person who built this tool has left the company probably before I started there 10 years ago. We currently have no support for this application and no one has access to the source code. I decided to create a new, simpler version of this tool. The tool enabled managers to manage our inventory of files. It is also a tool that is used by our assignment staff to assign files. 
Managers can add and remove departments as well ass add and remove employees to the departments. They can also view files assigned per employee by date to ensure everyone has the same amount of files to balance the inventory workload. 
Employees can assign files by selecting the department working the file and it will assign the file in a round robin fashion.
